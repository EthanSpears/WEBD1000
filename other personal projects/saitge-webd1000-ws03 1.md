**Week / Session:** 3

**Activity Title:** Requirements & Planning: Site Evaluation, Content Inventory & Sitemap

**Duration:** 2–2.5 hours

**Instructor:** Davis Boudreau

---

### 1. **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. Evaluate an existing case study for usability and accessibility using heuristics and checklists.
2. Identify and document content types for a website through a **content inventory**.
3. Create a **sitemap** representing the page hierarchy and navigation structure.
4. Define a preliminary content plan (header, hero, footer, main sections) for a redesign based on the **Corah Case Study**.

---

### 2. **Background / Context**

The **Corah Case Study** involves building a website for a community organization serving senior citizens in rural areas.

**Users:**

* **Primary:** Seniors (60+) with varying digital literacy.
* **Secondary:** CORAH staff managing events, communications, and outreach.

**Key Points:**

* Focus on accessibility, clear hierarchy, and simple navigation.
* This session focuses on **planning**: understanding content, flow, and user needs **before coding**.

---

### 3. **Materials / Tools**

* Corah Case Study brief and mockup wireframes (Week 2)
* Notebook or Google Doc for notes
* Browser with example websites for analysis
* Optional: spreadsheet or table template for content inventory

---

### 4. **Step-by-Step Instructions (Guided Tutorial)**

#### **Step 1: Review the Corah Case Study (10 min)**

* Read the Corah Case Study brief carefully.
* Identify key goals: helping seniors find events, contacting staff, signing up for newsletters.
* Discuss in pairs: “What content do you think is essential for these users?”

> **Non-attending students:** Read the brief independently and list all main content ideas.

---

#### **Step 2: Select a Reference Website (10 min)**

* Choose a live website **relevant to Corah’s context** (e.g., community centers, event listings, senior services).
* Open it in your browser.

**Task:** Identify good and bad examples of:

* Layout and navigation clarity
* Readability and font size
* Accessibility features (contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation)

> **Tip:** Take screenshots for reference.

---

#### **Step 3: Conduct a Site Evaluation (20 min)**

* Use the **heuristics and accessibility checklist** provided by the instructor:

  1. Clear headings and hierarchy
  2. Navigation is intuitive
  3. Text is readable (font size, contrast)
  4. Images have alt text
  5. Interactive elements are accessible

* Record **strengths and weaknesses** in a table:

| Page / Section | Strengths               | Weaknesses            | Notes / Recommendations                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Home           | Example: Clear headings | Example: Menu unclear | Suggest simple nav with Home/Events/About/Contact |
| Events         | ...                     | ...                   | ...                                               |

> **Non-attending students:** Conduct this evaluation independently using a website you choose.

---

#### **Step 4: Create a Content Inventory (20 min)**

* List **all content items** for the website you plan to redesign: headings, paragraphs, links, images, calls-to-action.
* Include where they will appear (header, hero section, main content, footer).

**Example Table:**

| Content Item    | Type           | Section | Notes / Priority                      |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Logo            | Image          | Header  | High priority, linked to Home         |
| Welcome message | Text           | Hero    | Short, friendly, senior-friendly font |
| Featured events | Text / article | Main    | Include date, description, CTA link   |
| Contact info    | Text           | Footer  | Ensure accessible formatting          |

---

#### **Step 5: Draft a Sitemap (20 min)**

* Draw a **simple hierarchical diagram** of pages and sections:

  * Start with main navigation: Home, Events, About, Contact
  * Add subsections under Events (Featured Events, Event Calendar)
  * Include footer links

**Tip:** You can use paper, whiteboard, or tools like Figma, Lucidchart, or Google Drawings.

**Example (textual):**

```
Home
├── Hero Section
├── Featured Events
├── Quick Links
Events
├── Featured Events
├── Event Calendar
About
Contact
└── Newsletter Signup
```

> **Non-attending students:** Create a sitemap independently based on your content inventory.

---

### 5. **Reflection Questions**

1. How did your content inventory help identify gaps or redundancies in the website?
2. Which usability or accessibility issues in the reference website stood out?
3. How will this planning step make HTML/CSS implementation easier in Week 4–5?

---

### 6. **Deliverables**

* Completed **site evaluation table**
* Completed **content inventory table**
* Draft **sitemap** for the Corah website redesign
* Answers to **reflection questions**
