## üéØ Learning Goals

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. Create and manipulate **lists** in Python.
2. Access, modify, append, and remove list elements.
3. Traverse lists using **for loops** and **index-based loops**.
4. Use **trace tables** to predict program behavior.
5. Reflect on your learning and debugging process.

## üìù Lab Exercises

### **Exercise 1: Creating and Accessing Lists**

1. Open VSCode and create a new Python file `week5_lists.py`.
2. Create a list of five fruits:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
```

3. Print the **first** and **last** items in the list.
4. Replace the **third item** with `"coconut"`.
5. Append `"fig"` to the list.
6. Remove `"banana"` from the list.
7. Print the **final list**.

### **Exercise 2: Traversing Lists**

1. Create a list of numeric grades:

```python
grades = [70, 85, 90, 65, 88]
```

2. Print all grades using a **for-each loop**.
3. Increase each grade by 5 using an **index-based loop**.
4. Append a new grade `92`.
5. Remove the **lowest grade**.
6. Print the **final list** and the **average grade**.

### **Exercise 3: Trace Table**

Complete the following trace table for **Exercise 2** after increasing grades by 5:

| Index | Original Value | Operation (+5) | Result |
| ----- | -------------- | -------------- | ------ |
|       |                |                |        |
|       |                |                |        |
|       |                |                |        |
|       |                |                |        |
|       |                |                |        |

---

### **Exercise 4: Nested Lists (Optional Challenge)**

1. Create a nested list of students with names and grades:

```python
students = [["Alice", 85], ["Bob", 90], ["Charlie", 78]]
```

2. Print each student's name and grade.
3. Add a new student `["Diana", 88]`.
4. Increase all grades by 2 points.
5. Print the updated list.

---

## ‚úÖ Deliverables

1. **Python file** `w#_ws5_lists.py` with all exercises completed.
2. **Trace table** `w#_ws5_trace_table.md` for Exercise 2 (before and after modifications).
3. **Optional:** `w#_ws5_optional.py` Extended nested list exercise.
4. **Reflection** `w#_ws5_lists.py`(3‚Äì4 sentences):

   * Which list operations were easiest?
   * Which caused errors or unexpected results, and how did you fix them?
   * How would you store **additional information per item** in a real-world program?

---

## üìÖ Submission

* Submit your **Python file**, **trace table**, and **reflection** via LMS by the end of **Week 5**.
