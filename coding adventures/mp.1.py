## The most challenging part of all of this is figuring out what i wanted to do, and what extra components i wanted to add once i finished the basic functions.
## The Trace Table helped me spot errors early in the function of my code, and helped me code in a much more well-paced and smooth fashion, rather than it feeling rushed
